## Instructions
To run this app:

Clone this repo.

Create a .env file in the server folder with MONGO_URL, JWT_SECRET, STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WEB_HOOK, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_ADDRESS, EMAIL_PASSWORD and FRONTEND_URL fields.

Create a .env file in the client folder with a REACT_APP_API_URL field.

There are two directories, server and client. You'll need to do the following on both.

Run npm install and npm start. You may be asked if you would like to run the program on another server. Type "Y" for Yes.

Your browser will automatically launch the app to its home page.

You can shut down both servers by typing Control C in the terminal window where they are running.
