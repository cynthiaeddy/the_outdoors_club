          </h5>
          <p>
            Please read carefully before signing. The following is a legal
            agreement including waivers of liability. Your agreement is a
            condition of membership and participation in any Outdoors Club
            Events.

          <h5>ASSUMPTION OF RISK</h5>
          <p>
            Any outdoor activity can be dangerous and there is an element of
            risk, which I, the signer, am accepting by participating in this
            activity. The signer acknowledges that the enjoyment and excitement
            of outdoor activities is derived in part from the inherent risks
            incurred by activity beyond the accepted safety of life at home or
            work, and that these inherent risks contribute to such enjoyment and
            excitement, and are reasons for my voluntary participation. I assume
            responsibility for my own safety and equipment, and I acknowledge
            and agree that I must be both physically and mentally prepared and
            equipped with the appropriate gear. Only I can judge my skills
            relative to the conditions found in outdoor environments and any
            possible risk. I alone decide when, where and how to proceed, or
            not. I acknowledge that I am aware of the inherent hazards and risks
            associated with participating in the Outdoors Club, including those
            associated with outdoor activity. I acknowledge that I have
            voluntarily chosen to participate Outdoors Club events. In so doing,
            I acknowledge that I may be subjecting myself to dangers and hazards
            which could result in illness, injury or death. I also acknowledge
            that there are inherent risks and dangers that may arise at any time
            during the activity. Inherent hazards and risks include, but are not
            limited to, risk of injury or death from: narrow roadways and/or
            trails, unpredictable roadway hazards and conditions; slips, and
            falls, unexpected trail conditions, misjudgment of terrain, my own
            or other’s negligence including the negligence of Outdoors Club
            Volunteers; I could also suffer injuries during the land
            transportation portions of the activity; consumption of alcoholic
            beverages, tainted food, or non-potable water; possible equipment
            failure and/or malfunction of my own or other's equipment; exposure
            to the elements, including heat, cold, sun, water, and wind; attack
            by or encounter with insects, including exposure to Lyme disease,
            reptiles, and/or animals; fatigue, chill, overheating, and/or
            dizziness, which may diminish my reaction time and increase the risk
            of accident; known or unknown medical conditions, physical exertion
            for which I am not prepared or other such accidents; the negligence
            or lack of adequate training of any volunteers of Outdoors Club or
            other Members who seek to assist with medical or other help either
            before or after injuries have occurred; accident or illness without
            access to means of rapid evacuation or availability of medical
            supplies or services; and the adequacy of medical attention once
            provided. I expressly acknowledge that naturally occurring diseases
            and viruses (including, but not limited to, the currently widespread
            COVID-19) may be present and actively occurring in all environments
            in which the outdoor activities will take place. I acknowledge the
            novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has been declared a worldwide pandemic
            by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is extremely contagious
            and is believed to spread mainly from person-to-person contact
            (however the exact method of spread remains unknown). I also
            understand that if I am older or have underlying conditions, I may
            be more prone to serious infection and death due to COVID-19. I
            acknowledge that, Outdoors Club, Inc., its directors, officers,
            volunteers, agents, and all other persons or entities acting in any
            capacity on their behalf (hereinafter collectively “Outdoors Club”),
            has taken steps to mitigate the potential for transmittal of, and
            exposure to COVID 19 during the outdoor activity, but that exposure
            to such viruses or disease is an inherent risk of participating in
            any activity, one that cannot be eliminated by Outdoors Club. In
            signing this release, I represent that I do not have COVID-19 or any
            symptoms associated with COVID-19 and agree that should I develop
            symptoms or am diagnosed with COVID-19 before or during an activity,
            I will inform Outdoors Club immediately and agree to abide by any
            decisions they make regarding my participation or continued
            participation in any outdoor activity. I understand the description
            of these risks is not complete and that unknown or unanticipated
            risks may result in injury, illness, or death. I agree to be
            responsible for my own wellbeing and negligence. I freely and
            voluntarily assume complete personal responsibility for these risks
            and for the injuries or death that may occur as a result of these
            risks, even if such injuries or death occur in a manner that is not
            foreseeable at the time this agreement is signed. RELEASE In
            consideration of my being permitted to participate in the trip, I
            agree to assume all risks of illness, injury or death, including all
            risks associated with COVID- 19, and agree not to sue and to release
            from liability and indemnify Outdoors Club, Inc., their directors,
            officers, volunteers, agents and other persons or entities involved
            with the activity (the Releasees), from all actions, claims or
            demands for injury, loss or damage, regardless of the cause,
            resulting from my participation in the trip, WHETHER ARISING FROM
            THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES OR OTHERWISE, to the fullest extent
            permitted by law. Furthermore, without limitation, Outdoors Club,
            Inc. is not responsible for any injury, loss, or damage to person or
            property, death, delay or inconvenience in connection with the
            provision of any goods or services occasioned by or resulting from,
            but not limited to, acts of God or force majeure, acts of war or
            civil unrest, insurrection or revolt, strikes or other labor
            activities, criminal or terrorist activities of any kind, epidemic,
            pandemic, mechanical or other failure of means of transportation, I
            agree that this release shall be legally binding upon me personally,
            all members of my family and all minors participating with me, my
            and their heirs, successors, assigns, and legal representatives, it
            being my intention fully to assume all the risks associated with
            this trip and to release Outdoors Club, Inc. from any and all
            liabilities to the maximum extent permitted by law. By entering into
            this Agreement, I am not relying on any oral or written
            representation or statements made by Outdoors Club, Inc., other than
            what is set forth in this Agreement. I agree that New York state
            will be the forum for resolution of any dispute related to my
            participation in this trip. Such proceedings will be governed by New
            York law. The parties understand and agree that all claims must be
            brought within six months following the completion of the tour. I
            agree that I will only bring claims against Outdoors Club, Inc. in
            my individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
            purported class action or representative proceeding. Outdoors Club,
            Inc. shall not in any case be liable for other than compensatory
            damages, and my signature and participation in any activity means
            that I agree to these conditions and expressly waive any right to
            punitive damages. All claims brought more than six months after the
            completion of an activity are forever waived and cannot be pursued
            in another forum. I understand that Outdoors Club has no
            responsibility to provide medical care to participants, and has made
            no offer or promise to do so. I authorize Outdoors Club to obtain
            medical care on my behalf and/or to transport me to a medical
            facility, if necessary, and I hereby release Outdoors Club from any
            and all liability arising from its obtaining medical care on my
            behalf or transporting me to a medical facility. I agree to pay for
            the cost of any evacuation or medical care. Without limiting any of
            the foregoing, I expressly waive any claim that I or anyone on my
            behalf may bring against Outdoors Club with regard to medical care
            and the provision or failure to provide such care. I grant Outdoors
            Club the absolute right to copyright, reuse, publish and republish
            by any medium, including electronically, any photos of me or in
            which I may be included, that may be taken while participating in an
            Outdoors Club activity. I also consent to the use of any printed
            matter in conjunction therewith. I have carefully read the agreement
            above. I understand that it is a release of liability and a contract
            between me and Outdoors Club, Inc., and I sign this agreement of my
            own free will. If any part of this agreement is deemed
            unenforceable, all other parts shall be given full force and effect.
            No additions, deletions or changes can be made to the release form,
            and signing it is a requirement for joining the Outdoors Club. By
            signing below the undersigned represents and warrants that they have
            the authority to sign this written agreement on behalf of all
            individuals whose legal rights this agreement contemplates to waive.
